# Toaq IME

An `ibus` IME for the Toaq language. If you have `ibus` already configured,
installation is simple.
First, make sure the `m17n` module is installed. Then,
just place `latn-toaq.mim` into the `~/.m17n.d/` folder and restart the
`ibus` daemon.

## Documentation

All keys are as normal, except `w`, `v`, or `y` type ꝡ, and `i` types ı.

For diacritics on vowels:
- To type rising tones, prefix the key with `/`.
- To type glottal tones, prefix the key with `;`.
- To type hiatus tones, prefix the key with `:`.
- To type underdots, prefix the key with `.`.

You can type any of those modifier keys themselves by double-typing them.
So, `//` types `/`.
